                <p1 class="artwork-descrip"> Acrylic Painting <br> 30.48*30.48 cm </p1>
                <p2 class="artwork-detailed"> This artwork expresses the loneliness of those who insist on themselves among many people who are following the trend. Since I was a kid, I did not like to drift with the current, but in my life, I found that sometimes I could not fit in. The red balloon is a symbol of the trend, or a common goal people are chasing. White dots are the crowds moving more and more to the balloon, but only the black dot, the girl, reflecting myself, is staying put resisting her own dream. </p2>

                <p1 class="artwork-descrip"> Photography <br> 38.1*28.6 cm </p1>
                <p2 class="artwork-detailed"> As the world is becoming more and more borderless, it is easy to lose traditions. My artistic intent for this photography artwork is to show the loss of artistic traditions from one generation to the next. Hand-colored photographs were the most common in the Republic of China era. But the skill of coloring black-and-white photographs is losing out today. Many symbolic elements like water, threads, and the reflection were included to better express the artistic intent. </p2>

                    <br> 27*39 cm </p1>
                <p2 class="artwork-detailed"> Alter ego means a person’s alternative personality. I came to Canada from China when in Grade 9. The artistic intent of this artwork is to show the balance between my dominant culture and the western culture. The two characters in the artwork are the two sides of my face, which show both my outside appearance and alter ego. The combination of ancient and modern elements in the artwork disrupts both time and space, representing the gradual integration of the two cultures in my identity. </p2>

                <p1 class="artwork-descrip"> Photography & Digital Drawing <br> 30.5*30.5 cm </p1>
                <p2 class="artwork-detailed"> This artwork reflects the inside feeling of being disconnected from the real world. The contrast between the bright “sky” created with polyester and the dark environment enhances the feeling of a split. The bird of paradise flower means freedom, identity, and paradise. It shows the inner freedom character’s yearning but the isolation from the outside world. The pattern on skin, like a tattoo, shows the character’s state involves an internal conflict people can’t see, but also can’t get rid of. </p2>

                <p2 class="artwork-detailed"> The artistic intent is to show the process of finding one’s identity under a great impact of other beauty standards. “Puzzle” represents the tangled state of characters under different aesthetic standards and expresses people’s identity as just like a puzzle, which is pieced together by different standards given by the public. Many symbolic elements were used to imply the changing- standards. This series creates an open ending and left to the viewer to imagine and reflect on themselves. </p2>

                <p2 class="artwork-detailed"> This artwork was made to reflect that the unattainable beauty standards on social media are controlling people’s minds, bringing a negative impact on their identity, and finally resulting in people losing themselves. The character’s wings, representing spirituality and one’s true identity, have gone from being spread freely, free to express her own thoughts, to being protective after receiving a lot of different (negative) comments on social media and starting to demand more from her body image. </p2>

                    <br> 50.8*33.9 cm </p1>
                <p2 class="artwork-detailed"> “Humanoid Vase” was created to satirize the objectification of women as commodities. When I was a child, I was exposed to a traditional view of women as vases, meaning that women only need to be beautiful and have no other use. The blue and white porcelain represents tradition as well as fragile products, symbolizing traditional women's vulnerability and dependence on others. Through my work, I hope to make people aware of this issue and try to become independent women. </p2>

                <p2 class="artwork-detailed"> This work combines realism in western art and Chinese elements, reflecting the combination of the two cultures in my identity. From the realistic scene at the beginning, the Western culture, I am exposed to, to the integration of blue and white porcelain into an apple, represents the process of embracing new culture into the dominant culture of my identity. In this colored pencil drawing, I try to make the object realistic and create a more realistic visual effect for the audience. </p2>
