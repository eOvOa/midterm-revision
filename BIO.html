        </heading-thinner>
        <descrip> I am a maker, a visual artist, and a dreamer ;)<br>
        <br> I have been very interested in art since I was a child. I remember my mom telling me that even when I was very little, I would grab any pen and draw whenever I saw one. Now, art has become a part of my life and a way to express my inner thoughts, including all the weird ones.<br>
        <br> My family and I moved to Canada when I was 14 years old. I experienced a great culture shock at the very beginning and I had been struggling to find my true identity for a long time. I do not know if I should change my self and forget my dominent culture to fit in the new western environment. It was art help me find the answer and taught me to balance my dominant culture and the new culture I am exposing myself to. This experience inspired me to create this art project "Identity".<br>
        <br> In this exhibition, I will use my artwork to explore different perspectives of identity. The artworks I have selected for this show interpret various aspects of identity. I explored many different materials and art forms to express my artistic intents. I hope the audience can feel resonate and generate some new thoughts when they perceive their own identity through my art exhibition.
